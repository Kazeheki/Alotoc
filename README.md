This project is a clock for everyone who wants a fixated clock on their screen.

The clock is always visible on top of everything. The color can be changed in the preferences by choosing a set color or by typing in a hex-value for the color. 

The clock is also draggable to wherever you want it to be.


To run it simply execute the Alotoc.jar file. 

It should display the time set by the system.

You can of course also write to me if you have a suggestion. :wink:)
